My name is Mohammad Tofik and I am studying at Manipal Institute of Technology in Manipal(B.Tech CSE MAHE). GitHub is an open-source repository hosting service, sort of like a cloud for code. GitHub is one of the most popular repository. I am writing the code and uploading for contribution to the github.
